Good question — this is a common problem when working with multilingual datasets!

You can easily filter out non-English text from your Excel data using Python (with pandas) and a language detection library like langdetect or langid. Here's a clean and practical way to do it:


---

Step 1: Install dependencies

pip install pandas langdetect openpyxl


---

Step 2: Python Script to Filter English Text

import pandas as pd
from langdetect import detect, DetectorFactory
from langdetect.lang_detect_exception import LangDetectException

# Fix for consistent language detection
DetectorFactory.seed = 0

# Load your Excel file
df = pd.read_excel('your_file.xlsx')

# Function to detect English text
def is_english(text):
    try:
        return detect(str(text)) == 'en'
    except LangDetectException:
        return False

# Apply the function to a specific column, e.g., 'YourColumn'
df['is_english'] = df['YourColumn'].apply(is_english)

# Keep only English rows
english_df = df[df['is_english'] == True].drop(columns=['is_english'])

# Save the cleaned data to a new Excel file
english_df.to_excel('english_only.xlsx', index=False)

print("English data saved to 'english_only.xlsx'")

Notes:

Replace 'YourColumn' with the actual name of the column you want to clean.

langdetect can handle short and long text.

If you want to apply this to multiple columns, we can expand the script — just tell me!

If you show me a sample of your Excel data (column names or a few rows), I can help you write the exact code for your case!
Want me to do that?


Great — please either:

1. Type here a few sample rows (just like how they appear, e.g.):



or

2. Upload your Excel file — I’ll write the exact code tailored to your data.



Your choice! Just share a small example and I’ll help you set it up perfectly.
